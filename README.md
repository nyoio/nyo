## background 
nyo is based on the following protocols:
* open index protocol for index metadata
* FLO blockchain for storage of indexed data
* ERC20 for governance protocol and governance
* SIA for content and data long term storage and availability

## how does it work?
all images uploaded to nyo are stored on a decentralized bittorrent-like network. anyone running a nyo front-end connects to the nyo network and can display those images 

## whatever, just let me see the gallery!
